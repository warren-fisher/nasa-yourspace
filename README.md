# Shopify frontend challenge Winter 2022 

## YourSpace
YourSpace is a play on the once-popular social media site MySpace. 
Instead of everyone creating their own "space", I created a "space" for everyone to learn about space.

### Development
YourSpace is made in NextJS (a React framework) with the help from Shopify's polaris component library.

## TODO:
- pages/with all prerendered pages per image(or maybe max 1000 or something)
- SEO stuff (meta tags, title, proper icon for tab)
- fonts maybe
- like button has a animation
    - #### when viewing so many images, dont wait to load all before you can view the first ones
- ## Bug report for Shopify Polaris DatePicker not SSR
- like button has a heart that goes broken -> red or black -> red
- perhaps cache all images on server (nah?)
- better background maybe?
