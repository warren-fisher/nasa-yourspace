# Shopify frontend challenge Winter 2022 

## YourSpace
YourSpace is a play on the once-popular social media site MySpace. 
Instead of everyone creating their own "space", I created a "space" for everyone to learn about space.

### Development
YourSpace is made in NextJS (a React framework) with the help from Shopify's polaris component library.

## TODO:
- darkmode 
- mobile maybe can use non-hd images 
- calendar searching between dates 
- likes (save to localStorage) 
- pages/with all prerendered pages per image(or maybe max 1000 or something)
- SEO stuff (meta tags, title, proper icon for tab)
- fonts maybe
- can optionally view description in a dropdown or something like that maybe??? (possibly not)
- like button has a animation
- being able to view many images at once even
    - either between dates 
    - or by using the count=? api endpoint 
    - #### when viewing so many images, dont wait to load all before you can view the first ones
- ## Bug report for Shopify Polaris DatePicker not SSR
- like button has a heart that goes broken -> red or black -> red
- ## support videos like on Sept 05 2021
- support picking start and end date
- perhaps use non-hd images always
- perhaps cache all images on server (nah?)
